This work intends to reveal the relationship between the diversity and the resistance potential of microbial community through in silico modeling. 

## Description 
Microbiome plays important roles to protect humans from the invasion of pathogens, which known as colonization resistance. The relationship between diversity of the community and resistance potential is a classical question for community ecology, known as invasion paradox, that both the positive and negative relationships have been observed. In order to dissolve the paradox, we use mediator-explicit model and microbial consumer resource model (MiCRM) to simulate the dynamics of microbial community, and introduce an invader to the stable community to examine the invasion outcomes and its relationship with the diversity.
