# Mediator-explicit model

## Description 
Mediator-explicit model is firstly introduced in the paper "Niehaus et al (2019). Microbial coexistence through chemical-mediated interactions. Nature Communications. https://doi.org/10.1038/S41467-019-10062-X". It takes the chemicals that either produced or comsumed by the microbial species as the mediator and the interactions between species are indirectly represented by the interactions between chemicals and species. For more details, take a look of the paper.
